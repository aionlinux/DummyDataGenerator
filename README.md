# DummyDataGenerator

This script provides a straightforward method for generating placeholder data that mimics the interactions between sales staff and leads in a timeshare context. It's suitable for anyone needing to populate databases or systems with fictitious yet plausible data for development, testing, or demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Generates fake client information using the `Faker` library.
- Produces realistic notes simulating sales interactions, leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
- Creates documents in PDF, DOCX, and XLSX formats with the generated data.
- Fully customizable output for different scenarios and needs.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- `openai` Python package
- `Faker` Python package
- `fpdf` Python package for PDF creation
- `python-docx` Python package for DOCX creation
- `openpyxl` Python package for XLSX creation

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable for security. For example, in your `.bashrc` file, add the following line: `export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'`.
4. Make sure to source your `.bashrc` file after adding the above line or restart your terminal session.

## Usage

To generate the dummy data documents, run the script from the terminal:

```bash
python3 dummy_data_generator.py
```

You can adjust the number of documents generated by modifying the num_docs argument in generate_documents(num_docs, output_directory).

### Customization
Modifying Notes Content
To alter the type of sales interaction notes generated by the script, you can modify the content parameter within the openai.ChatCompletion.create() function call. Tailor the prompt to fit the scenario you wish to simulate.

### Model Adjustments
The script uses the gpt-3.5-turbo model by default. You can change the model used by modifying the model parameter in the same function call. Refer to the OpenAI API documentation for details on available models and their capabilities.

### Token Allocation
The max_tokens parameter controls the length of the completion generated by the model. Adjust this number based on your requirements for the length of the notes.
