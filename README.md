# DummyDataGenerator

## Overview
This project contains a Python script designed to generate dummy data documents for testing purposes. It creates a variety of documents in different formats such as PDF, DOCX, and XLSX, simulating real-world data scenarios for a timeshare business. The documents include data such as client names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other relevant sales and leads information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:

- `faker`: for generating dummy data.
- `fpdf`: for creating PDF files.
- `python-docx`: for creating Word documents.
- `openpyxl`: for creating Excel files.

You can install these with the following command:

```bash
pip install faker fpdf python-docx openpyxl
```

### Installation
To use the DummyDataGenerator, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aionlinux/DummyDataGenerator.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd DummyDataGenerator
```

### Usage
To generate the dummy data documents, run the script with:

```bash
python dummy_data_generator.py
```

By default, the script will generate 1,000 documents in a mixture of PDF, DOCX, and XLSX formats.

## Customization
You can customize the number of documents generated by editing the `generate_documents(1000)` call at the bottom of the `dummy_data_generator.py` script.
